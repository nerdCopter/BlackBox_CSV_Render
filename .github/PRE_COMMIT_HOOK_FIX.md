# Pre-commit Hook Auto-staging Fix

## Problem Description

The pre-commit hook was causing workflow disruption due to timing issues between `cargo fmt` and git staging:

### Previous Behavior (Problematic)
1. User stages files: `git add file.rs`
2. User commits: `git commit -m "message"`
3. Pre-commit hook runs `cargo fmt` ‚Üí **modifies files on disk**
4. Commit completes with originally staged content
5. **Formatting changes left unstaged** ‚Üí user sees modified files after "successful" commit

### User Experience Issues
- Confusing to see modified files immediately after committing
- Required additional `git add` and `git commit` after every commit
- Broke assumption that successful commit = clean working directory
- Disrupted normal git workflow expectations

## Solution Implemented

### New Behavior (Fixed)
1. User stages files: `git add file.rs`
2. User commits: `git commit -m "message"`
3. Pre-commit hook runs `cargo fmt` ‚Üí modifies files on disk
4. **Hook automatically runs `git add -u`** ‚Üí stages formatting changes
5. Commit completes with **formatted content included**
6. **Repository stays clean** ‚Üí no leftover modifications

### Technical Implementation
Added one line to the pre-commit hook after `cargo fmt`:
```bash
# Auto-stage any formatting changes made by cargo fmt
echo "üìù Staging formatting changes..."
git add -u
```

The `git add -u` command stages all modified files that are already tracked, which includes any files that were just formatted by `cargo fmt`.

## Benefits

### For Developers
- **Clean workflow**: No unexpected modified files after commits
- **Atomic commits**: User changes and formatting included together
- **No extra steps**: Single commit operation handles everything
- **Predictable behavior**: Successful commit = clean working directory

### For Project Quality
- **Consistent formatting**: All commits include properly formatted code
- **Automated compliance**: No manual formatting steps required
- **Reduced friction**: Easier to maintain code quality standards
- **Better git history**: Clean commits without separate formatting commits

## Installation

### New Users
Run the setup script to install the updated hook:
```bash
./.github/setup-dev.sh
```

### Existing Users
Re-run the setup script to update your hook:
```bash
./.github/setup-dev.sh
```

Or manually update your existing hook:
```bash
cp .github/pre-commit-hook.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## Verification

To verify the fix is working correctly:

1. Make some code changes with intentional formatting issues
2. Stage and commit the changes
3. Observe that the hook formats the code AND includes the formatting in the commit
4. Verify that `git status` shows a clean working directory after commit

### Expected Output
```
üîç Running pre-commit checks...
üìù Formatting code with cargo fmt...
üìù Staging formatting changes...
‚úÖ Checking formatting compliance...
üîç Running clippy checks...
‚úÖ All pre-commit checks passed!
```

Notice the new "Staging formatting changes..." step that ensures formatted code is included in the commit.

## Backwards Compatibility

This change is fully backwards compatible:
- Existing functionality remains unchanged
- All validation and error handling preserved
- Same exit codes and error messages
- Only improvement is elimination of unstaged changes after commit

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Option A: Check-only approach
Only validate formatting without auto-fixing:
- **Pros**: Explicit user control over formatting
- **Cons**: More friction, requires manual formatting steps

### Option B: Format-and-stage (Implemented)
Auto-format and include in current commit:
- **Pros**: Seamless workflow, atomic commits
- **Cons**: Less explicit control (but cargo fmt is deterministic)

**Chosen Option B** because it provides the best developer experience while maintaining code quality standards.

## Technical Notes

### Safety Considerations
- `git add -u` only stages **modified tracked files**, not new files
- Maintains git safety by not staging unintended files
- Preserves user's explicit staging decisions for new files

### Performance Impact
- Negligible performance overhead (single git command)
- No additional formatting passes (same cargo fmt call)
- Slightly faster overall (eliminates need for separate formatting commits)

### Error Handling
- If `cargo fmt` fails, hook exits before staging (maintains safety)
- All existing error conditions and messages preserved
- Clear feedback about what the hook is doing at each step

This fix transforms the pre-commit hook from a source of workflow friction into a seamless quality assurance tool that maintains both code standards and developer productivity.
