# IMUF Filter Support Implementation Summary

## Issue Solved
✅ **Issue #2 for EmuFLight HELIOSPRING**: Successfully implemented IMUF (IMU-F) filter support for HELIOSPRING flight controllers with external IMU-F filtering.

## What was Implemented

### 1. New Data Structures
- **`ImufFilterConfig`**: Stores IMUF filter configuration including lowpass cutoff, PTn order, Q-factor, and enabled state
- **Extended `AxisFilterConfig`**: Added `imuf: Option<ImufFilterConfig>` field to support IMUF filters alongside standard filters

### 2. IMUF Parameter Parsing
- **`parse_imuf_filters()`**: Parses IMUF parameters from EmuFlight HELIOSPRING headers:
  - `IMUF_lowpass_roll`, `IMUF_lowpass_pitch`, `IMUF_lowpass_yaw` - per-axis lowpass cutoffs (Hz)
  - `IMUF_roll_q`, `IMUF_pitch_q`, `IMUF_yaw_q` - Q-factors scaled by 1000 (divided by 1000 in parsing)
  - `IMUF_ptn_order` - filter order (1-4 corresponding to PT1, PT2, PT3, PT4)
  - `IMUF_acc_lpf_cutoff` - accelerometer lowpass cutoff (for future use)
  - `IMUF_w` - pseudo-Kalman filter window size (documented but not used per user request)

### 3. Filter Response Curve Generation
- **Enhanced `generate_individual_filter_curves()`**: Added IMUF filter curve generation
- Uses existing PT1-PT4 implementations based on `IMUF_ptn_order`
- Generates properly labeled curves: "IMUF (PT2 @ 90Hz, Q=8.0)"

### 4. Detection and Integration
- **Auto-detection**: Detects IMUF parameters in headers automatically
- **Coexistence**: IMUF filters can coexist with standard EmuFlight filters
- **Debug output**: Shows parsed IMUF configuration with detailed information

### 5. Filter Response Curves in Plots
- IMUF filter response curves are automatically included in gyro spectrum plots
- Each IMUF filter appears as a separate curve with distinct color
- Proper legend labels show filter type, cutoff frequency, and Q-factor

## Test Results
✅ **All unit tests pass** including new IMUF-specific tests:
- `test_imuf_filter_parsing()` - Verifies parameter parsing
- `test_imuf_filter_detection()` - Verifies auto-detection
- `test_imuf_filter_curves()` - Verifies curve generation

✅ **Real-world testing** with HELIOSPRING header file shows:
- Proper detection: "Detected EmuFlight HELIOSPRING IMUF filter configuration"
- Correct parsing: "IMUF: PT2 at 90 Hz (Q=8.0, order=2)" for all axes
- Filter response curves included in generated spectrum plots

## Technical Implementation Details

### Filter Chain Understanding
Based on EMU-F repository analysis:
```
Raw Gyro → IMUF_lowpass (per-axis) → PTn filter (IMUF_ptn_order) → Pseudo-Kalman → Flight Controller
```

### Parameter Mapping
- `IMUF_ptn_order` → PT1/PT2/PT3/PT4 filter types
- `IMUF_*_q` values scaled down by 1000 (8000 → 8.0)
- Per-axis lowpass cutoffs used directly in Hz

### Integration Points
- **Detection**: Added to `parse_filter_config()` with priority detection
- **Parsing**: Separate `parse_imuf_filters()` function with proper error handling
- **Curves**: Integrated into existing filter response curve system
- **Plotting**: Automatically included in gyro spectrum comparative plots

## Compliance with Requirements
✅ **No pseudo-Kalman research needed**: Used existing PT1-PT4 implementations as requested
✅ **Header metadata parsing**: All IMUF parameters parsed from headers  
✅ **Pre-existing implementations**: Leveraged existing PT filter implementations
✅ **Q-factor support**: Parsed and displayed but used simple PT filters as instructed
✅ **Coexistence**: Works alongside existing EmuFlight filter configurations

## Files Modified
- `src/data_analysis/filter_response.rs` - Main implementation with IMUF structures, parsing, and curve generation
- Comprehensive test coverage added for all new functionality

The implementation successfully addresses issue #2 by providing complete IMUF filter support for EmuFlight HELIOSPRING flight controllers with proper parsing, curve generation, and integration into the existing filter response system.
